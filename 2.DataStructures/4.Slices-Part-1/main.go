 Slices are the most important data structure in Golang. It gives us the mechanical sympathy of
 arrays but are also dynamic.

 Out of the 3 classes of types we have in golang:
	1.  Built-in
	2.	Reference
	3.  Struct/User Defined.

	Reference type and Built-in types use value semantics to move the data around.
