/*
	Cancellation pattern is an important pattern if you are building, web services or long running servers,
	that perform tasks because no webrequest or task can take forever, we have to at some point decide to quit
	and send back the result ot the client.

	If we are not dealing with timeouts then we will cause problems in our server.
	They will implode because if we have go routines running from a long time and we have new work
	constantly coming in.
	So one of the most important things we can do in a server, is identify what is the maximum amount of
	time we will take to handle and set timeouts for things like database calls, web calls, external calls.
	We may not know what these time outs are while we are developing the code but we want to lay these time outs in
	and eventually when we start doing some load testing figure out what these numbers are.
	So cancellation is something we have to do early on in the design and architecture of our software
	even though we might know what these numbers are upfront.
	We use the context package to do the cancellation.

	"duration := 150 * time.Millisecond"
	We are going to perform some operation ad we will only wait 150 milliseconds for it to complete.

	"context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), duration)"
	withTimeout function says is pass me an existing context that's in play. Tell me what the duration is and I
	will give you a new context.
	Note that context.WithTimeout use value semantics mutation. We pass a context in we get a context out.
	A lot of the reason for that is because higher level calls should be telling lower level calls,
	how long they want to wait and what they want to do, state changes and a lot fo this has to be local to where
	we are in the call stack we don't want to affect things above the call stack, everything is local.

	context.Background() is an empty context, it's where we start.
	So we start with context.Background() and we set a 150 millisecond of duration and we get a brand new context
	and the cancel function.
	It's critically important that the cancel function is called at least once so, we defer cancel() in our case.

	cancel() can get multiple times but if it s not called at least once then we can leak memory in go.
	So when we have a memory leak first thing we should look at is, are we using context, are we calling cancel.
	Cancel has to get called.
	Next we create a buffered channel,
	"ch := make(chan string, 1)"
	So that we can signal a string data and we are taking some risks because there are not going to be any guarantees.
	At least no guarantee of one signal send.

	Next we launch the go routines and we tell the go routine to go and do some work.
	This go routine can run longer than the 150 milli seconds timeout that we are setting up in the context.

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond) // simulate the wok
		ch <- "data"
	}()

	Once the go routine finishes the work it will signal the results back over to us.
	while the go routine is off and doing the work, we are
	in our select case.

	select {
	case d := <-ch:
		fmt.Println("work complete", d)

	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Println("work cancelled")
	}

	Note there are no default here so this is a blocking call, and there are 2 signals here that we are blocking on.
	We are hoping that the go routine will execute `ch <- "data"` and signal.
	That is the work got done under 150 ms (context timeout) but in case it doesn't then we are also blocked on
	signal "case <-ctx.Done():"
	Immediately when we call the done method the clock starts running on the 150 milli seconds duration.
	Now the clock is set.
	Hopefully the go routine signals
	"ch<-`paper`"
	within 150 ms time frame because if it doesn't then this case will signal first
	"case <-ctx.Done():"
	and we are going to move on.

	This is how cancellation works with context.

	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

	Let's see a bug that a lot of developers produce with cancellation. It comes from not setting the channel correctly.
	See main-1.go
