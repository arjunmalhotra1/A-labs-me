/*
	We now look at the Fanout pattern.
	Say we have 2000 employees that we will launch off to do some work.
	Idea of fan out pattern is that we have a bunch of work to do.
	We have a Go routine and it's on it's path and we realize that we have individual pieces of work to
	do. We could do it ourselves but we decide that we will go off and launch a go routine for every piece of work
	See 1.png. We will wait for all that work to come back.
	All the go routines that rae launched for the pieces of work will signal back when they are done.
	then the go routine moves on, 2.png. This is the idea of fanout pattern.

	In this example we will have 2000 pieces of work that we would want to do.
	We set the "children" variable to be equal to 2000.
	We use buffered channel here -
	"ch := make(chan string, children)"
	Buffered channel means that we will not take the guarantee that a signal being sent has been received.
	We are moving the guarantee away from the signalling. The actual signalling mechanics to outside of it.

	So now 2000 go routines are going off and doing the work that they already know how to do.
	We don't know how long is it going to take to get any of the work done.
	"time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(200)) * time.Millisecond)"
	While those go routines are going out to work, we are going to wait for all of those results to come back.

	"for children > 0 {"
	Here we are saying if there's no more work to do we will be done. While there is we will continue to loop.
	Then we block on our channel receive "ch<-"data".

	go routines when they start to finish their work then they start to signal
	ch <- "paper" send us that work done.
	Because we got the buffered channel, the channel is set up so every single go routine doesn't block on their
	send at least as it relates to it's receive.
	All we are doing is reducing the latency between the send and the receive without the guarantee.
	But what if 2 or more go routines want to execute
	`ch <- "paper"` at the same time. Then we have a synchronization problem again.
	The channel will perform the synchronization.
	We still may see latency on the send side but its' not because of receive but it's due to the fact
	that multiple sends are happening at the same time.

	But once the send completes, it doesn't need the receiver on the other end to finish.
	The send happens before the receive.
	Sends are "ch <- `paper`" putting data into the channel, signalling.
	The local variable "children" is acting as a wait group.
	It is giving us that local count on how many of the receives we have finished.

	Fanout patterns are dangerous because we can throw a lot of load on the system and external systems
	at the same time.
	Imagine we have a webservice running 50,000 go routines at any given time.
	If we allow those go routines to perform fan out patterns even if there were 20 go routines on the fan out,
	then we would have 1,000,000 go routines in flight.
	We can use fan out patterns for
	CLI tools, cron jobs, lambda functions, but when it comes to web services we have to be careful.
